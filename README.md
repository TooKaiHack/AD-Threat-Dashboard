## 📖 Description

The **Active Directory Threat Dashboard** is a web-based application designed to analyze and visualize critical events from Active Directory logs. This project demonstrates how to identify and monitor sensitive actions within an Active Directory environment, such as user account creation, password changes, and group membership modifications. It is intended as an educational tool for labs and exercises in cybersecurity.

## 🚀 Features

- **Event Analysis by Event ID**: Visualize the number of critical events by their unique IDs, including detailed descriptions.
- **User Activity Monitoring**: Identify users involved in critical actions.
- **Time-Based Trends**: Track the occurrence of critical events over time.
- **Detailed Logs by User**: Explore logs associated with specific users, including timestamps, event descriptions, and details.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Dash**: For building the interactive web dashboard.
- **Plotly**: For creating dynamic, visually appealing charts.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Flask**: Backend server for serving the application.
- **PowerShell**: To extract critical Active Directory logs.

## 🖼️ Application Overview

### **Key Features:**
- **Event Breakdown by Type**: Analyze critical events such as user account creation, password changes, and group modifications.
- **User-Based Analysis**: Identify users performing sensitive actions.
- **Time-Series Trends**: Monitor activity over specific time periods.

## 📊 How It Works

1. **Log Extraction**:
   - Use PowerShell scripts to extract Active Directory event logs.
   - Filter and export critical events (e.g., 4720, 4732, 4723) to a CSV file.

2. **Data Analysis**:
   - Load the log data into Python using Pandas.
   - Group and aggregate the data by Event ID, User, and Date for visualization.

3. **Dashboard Creation**:
   - Use Dash and Plotly to build interactive visualizations for:
     - Event counts by type.
     - User activity monitoring.
     - Temporal trends.

4. **Future Enhancements**:
   - Integrate real-time monitoring with Elasticsearch or Splunk.
   - Expand to hybrid environments with Azure AD support.
